[This](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28017289) is an interesting discussion on Hacker News for a process to learn new things quickly.

Here are some of the top answers summarized.

- For a new programming language, there are a couple of standard things you should try to implement.

  Write several programs where you

  - Read/write to a file
  - Turn a structured object into JSON
  - Parse JSON into an object
  - A basic script that can be run from the CLI, parses flags/args, reads stdin
  - Send a HTTP request
  - Implement a very basic web server

  When you’re doing these exercises, **do not copy/paste any code**.

  You should be typing out the code yourself.

- Try to bias towards reading (blogs, documentation, code, books, etc.) over watching video tutorials. Reading is a lot faster than watching video and you can be far more efficient with your time.

- A 3 step process for learning new frameworks is to divide it up into a week’s work (10 - 15 hour total commitment)

  - *Prepare* - Spend 1 hour Monday through Thursday reading documentation, books, and watching content. This way you’ll have time to sleep on the concepts.
  - *Plan* - On Friday, spend 1 hour preparing a small project idea for the weekend that will use all the concepts you learned over the week.
  - *Project* - Spend 4 - 6 hours building the project over the weekend.
